# Phase-Ambiguity-Resolver-using-Differential-Decoding-
Phase ambiguity in QPSK arises because the carrier can lock with 0째, 90째, 180째, or 270째 rotation, causing bit errors. Differential decoding solves this by encoding data in the phase difference between consecutive symbols, so correct detection is possible regardless of absolute constellation rotation.
